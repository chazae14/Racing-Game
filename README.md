A fully functioning, two-player racing game using Python. 
The objective of the game was to avoid the tumbleweeds coming towards the character by switching lanes. If a player was hit by a tumbleweed, they had to start again from the beginning. The first player to get to the finish line won a point. The game ended when the players clicked on “End Game” button. Then, a credit scene with the final scores appeared. 
- Used a multitude of Python libraries such as graphics, math, and random to import the proper functions. 
- Created rudimentary graphics to represent both the players and tumbleweeds. 
- Functions, while/for loops, and if structures were utilized. 
- Flowcharts and pseudocode were used to plan out the game and its code.
